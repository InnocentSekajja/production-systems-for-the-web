              Hey guys,

Thank you for visiting my site.
Well, I am just a kid from Africa (Uganda) who has always had a passion for music.
In my early primary school days, I had an interest in South African music and I used to do some serious leg movements with my grand parents herdsman to these Soweto tunes.

In the later years of primary school, I developed an interest in rap and R n B music. I listened to everything old skool.
In those days music was either on a cassette tape or radio. I would record music to cassette from radio or save money and buy a cassette album.
I started writing down the lyrics to my favourite songs by playing and rewinding the tapes I had.
I became so good at it and started to memorise many raps. My friends always asked me to rap for them and soon everyone knew me as "the kid that raps".

In my final year of primary, we were having a leavers party when the DJ played an instrumental and asked MCs to step to the mic.
I cued up but unfortunately some dude was too "tight" with the mic he never gave me an opportunity to deliver some hit to the crowd.
Since leaving primary, I kept getting better at my art and always knew that music was what I wanted to do.
I hope you like my tunes. Please share them with your friends and family and if you are impressed, buying a copy of the album would be great.

Thanks

Innocent
